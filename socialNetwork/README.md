# Microservices Profiling for Social Networks

This project presents a comprehensive deployment and performance evaluation of the DeathStarBench social network, a microservices-based application. We have integrated a full monitoring stackâ€”including Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, cAdvisor, and Blackbox Exporterâ€”to achieve deep observability into the system's performance under various workloads. [cite: 794, 908, 944]

The primary goals were to deploy the application, simulate realistic user traffic using `wrk2`, trace requests with Jaeger, and analyze performance data to identify and address system bottlenecks. [cite: 653, 656, 897, 899]

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

* **Deploy:** Successfully deploy all social network microservices using Docker Compose. [cite: 654, 898]
* **Load Testing:** Execute a realistic read/write workload using `wrk2` to stress-test the system. [cite: 655, 899]
* **Monitoring & Tracing:** Instrument and monitor services using Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana to record and visualize performance data. [cite: 656]
* **Bottleneck Identification:** Analyze trace and metrics data to discover performance hotspots and sources of latency. [cite: 657, 900]
